Lab 09 walk through

## Intro

* This week in class we are talking about hypothesis tests and confidence
  intervals concerning a single proporiton or the difference between two
  proportions.

* Today we are going to look at a data set concerning atheism to explore these
  concepts.

* The Washington Post and Huffington Post recently reported on the rise of
  atheism in America.

* Those stories were based on a survey done by Gallup-International (not
  affiliated with Gallup in the US) that looked at attitudes towards
  religiousity and atheism across the world.

	Specifically the survey asked: 

    "Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship or not, would you say
    you are a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?"

* Point out document link and bring it up --- You will need to familiarize
  yourself with this document for the lab.

* In any statistical analysis (including your project) you want to make sure to
  pay attention to a few key details like

	+ What is the population?
	+ What are the cases you actually observe?
	+ How was the data collected?

  Let's look at the document: literally, just read the first 5 paragraphs
  starting with "Zurich, 27 July 2012".

  Can we say anything about the population, cases, or how the data was collected
  from these first few paragraphs?

* Now that we know a little bit about the population and how the data was
  collected, let's check out the actual data set.  (Download data)

	+ Dataset is called atheism.
	+ The cases are people.
	+ The variables are nationality, response (atheist or not), year of survey.
    + We can only see the first 1000 cases in RStudio---if we could see more we
      would see lots of other nationalities and that some cases responded
      "atheist".

* There are a couple differnt types of questions we can answer using this
  dataset, for instance we could ask:

	+ "What proportion of people in country X are atheist?" or
	+ "Has the proportion of atheists in country X changed over time?"

  These are the types of questions you will be answering today in your lab.

* Get to work, I will interrupt lab a couple times to clarify some sticky spots.

## Sticky parts

* Maximum margin of error

* Excercise 10

    + Creating multiple plots using par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    + Noting that the skew is different for each plot.

* On your own part 1: overlapping intervals

* On your own part 2: multiple hyp. tests, binomial connection.

* On your own part 3: call back to maximum margin of error
