In addition to "regular programming" from Coursera and OIS, this week I'll be providing more information about your final project so you can begin working on your proposal (due next Thursday). I'll also be going over Midterm 1 problems/scores, addressing some nuances from Unit 3 (diving deeper into the idea of a confidence interval), and providing additional content about reporting and interpreting data/statistics.
