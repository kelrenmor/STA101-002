# Week 1

---

This week, we wrap up Unit 1 (Introduction to Data) on Monday, work through Unit 2 (Probability and distributions) Tuesday through Thursday, and begin Unit 3 (Foundations for inference) on Friday. We will also have a "data science in action" seminar from Dr. Josh Hewitt. Don't forget to pay attention to what is due each day. In addition to the video quizzes and application exercises, we will have a seminar reflection, two labs, and two problem sets due this week.
