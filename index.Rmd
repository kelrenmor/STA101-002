# Welcome to STA101-002!

### About the Course

STA 101-002 introduces students to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Throughout the semester, students will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: How to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. The course emphasizes examples from marine science, environmental science, conservation and energy issues. It is ordinarily taught in person at Duke's Marine Lab campus, but will be taught asynchronously online for Summer Term 1 2020.

Work ethic, the ability to self-motivate, flexibility, logical thinking, professionalism, and communication skills are all strong predictors of success in STA 101-002 (as well as in the working world). Don't worry if you haven't mastered all of these -- we'll work on them in class! 

### Class Meetings

### Teaching team and office hours 


Note: office hours may vary. Revisions to office hours will be noted via e-mail and on the webpage. 

| Team member | Office hours | Location |

### Materials

The course textbook is [OpenIntro Statistics 4th Ed](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics) - Diez, Barr, Cetinkaya-Rundel (2019). It is free online, or can be purchased from Amazon at cost of printing. Additional texts and readings will be assigned as needed. We will support computation in R and RStudio. You will be allowed to use a calculator in class; a simple calculator that can take square roots will be sufficient.

### Topics and Important Dates

STA 101-002 contain a mixture of short video lectures, textbook readings, seminar presentations, lab, and work sessions. Frequent smaller-scale problem sets and labs will be provided to check mastery and identify areas for additional focus. There is a tight turnaround on due dates to ensure no one falls behind; in return, .

Note: this schedule is approximate and is likely to be modified as the course progresses. Some sessions may be swapped due to course timing. Assignments are due by 11:59 PM EDT unless otherwise specified.
