# Learning Objectives

- learn the basic features that complicate analysis of longitudinal data
- understand why interaction is a crucial consideration for longitudinal data
- learn about the framework of hierarchical models and the linear mixed effects model
- weigh different covariance functions for correlated data
- learn about missing data patterns and mechanisms, and understand how to determine appropriate methods for analysis of data subject to missing values

# Case Study Goals

- Describe per capita household income (scaled to year 2015 dollars) over time in the CHNS
- Determine whether changes in per capita household income over time vary by province or urban/rural status
- Determine whether patterns of  household income over time vary by income source (business, farming, fishing, etc.)
- Determine whether income inequality is increasing over time, and whether any changes vary across province, urban/rural status, or source of primary income


# Data

- Data for this case study are available on the Sakai website in a SAS dataset. The function *read_sas* in the *haven* package can be used to pull them into R. 
- Other CHNS household and individual-level data can be downloaded from the [CHNS Website](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/data/datasets) by providing basic personal information.

# Assignments and Reports

- Report, reproducible code, and video (Group assignment due 6/3): produce a 8 page (maximum) report using R markdown that clearly addresses the case study goals. This report should follow the format of a standard scientific report and should include sections for the introduction, methods, results, and discussion. The methods section should clearly identify the approach to model selection and evaluation, and the results section should clearly specify the final model selected, along with evidence the model provides a good fit to the data. Code should be fully reproducible.

- Peer review of reports (Individual assignment due 6/4): using the peer review rubric provided, provide constructive feedback on the other group's report you have been assigned

- Revised report and response to reviews (Group assignment due 6/5): groups may submit revised reports and must submit a point-by-point response to the review comments provided
