### Policies

Your group has a number of responsibilities for team assignments, described below.

- Designate a coordinator, recorder, and monitor, checker, reviewer for each assignment. These should vary so that each group member takes a different role on a new assignment. Since teams are smaller, members will need to take on multiple roles.
- Agree on meeting times in advance and on what each member should have complete before the meetings (readings, initial analysis, coding, etc.)
- Do the required individual preparation.
- Coordinator sends reminder before meeting that includes meeting location, time, and individual preparation assignments.
- Meet and work. Coordinator keeps everyone on task and makes sure everyone is involved, recorder prepares final solution to be turned in, monitor makes sure everyone understands the solution, including the coding, the checker double-checks the work for reproducibility (and errors!), and the reviewer is responsible for (1) sharing comments on the graded lab with the team (2) leading a discussion about them, with a focus on the revision and how to improve moving forward, and (3) reviewing effort apportionment in a constructive conversation with the team.
- Checker turns in assignment, which also indicates which student took on each role.
- All team members complete written evaluations of effort put forth by other team members.
- Reviewer coordinates review of returned assignments.

### Team expectations agreement

On the Sakai submission titled "Team expectations agreement", list the names of all group members along with a list of expectations the team wishes to adopt. Suggestions are below, but you can add or subtract any items as needed. Each member should sign the sheet and turn it in within two days of group formation.

Potential expectations include the following (not an exhaustive list!):

- Make a serious effort at assigned work before meetings
- Make sure anyone who misses a meeting for a good cause gets caught up on progress
- Attend meetings, or ensure you understand your responsibilities if unable to attend synchronous meeting
- Show up on time and stay for full meeting when possible
- Notify project coordinator as soon as possible if unable to attend a meeting or fulfill a responsibility
- Listen thoughtfully to all team members
- Follow up promptly on assigned tasks
- Complete high quality work
- Discuss team-related issues frankly and honestly with the group
- You get the picture!

### Group evaluations

After each lab, each group member may provide evaluations of the other team members on Sakai. In the case you feel one or more team members deserves a different grade on the assignment than the others, you'll provide an estimate of the percentage of the work done by that team member and why that member or members deserves a different grade. If needed, I will scale an individual's grade as appropriate by contribution reported by other team members. If you provide a low score but do not justify your rating, it will be disregarded. If you do not submit an evaluation, it will be assumed that you felt that each group member participated appropriately and deserves the same grade. At no time will the rating or feedback an individual made be directly shared with the rest of their team.

If a team member indicates each group member participated appropriately, but later voices a complaint that the work was not equally divided, then evaluations will be consulted (and if, at the time, you felt work was equally divided, then that will be used as strong evidence against your claim).  That is, it's generally not to your advantage to ``be nice'' and give everyone equal credit if it is not deserved.

At any time a group can request a meeting with the instructor to discuss group dynamics or other challenges.
